In the Spring 2020 semester, I served as lead Teaching Assistant for the Data Science Workshop Series hosted by the Hertie School Data Science Lab and the SCRIPTS Data and Methdology Center. The goal of this workshop series is to create a space for faculty and researchers at the Hertie School and the SCRIPTS Research Cluster of Excellence to efficiently catch up with recent developments in data science topics and tools.

In this role, I developed course materials and assisted in the instruction of three sessions:

- [A gentle introduction to base `R` and RStudio](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-r-intro)
- [Modern data management with R](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-datamanagement)
- [Data Visualization with `ggplot2`](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-dataviz)
