The goal of this workshop series is to create a space for faculty and researchers at the Hertie School and the SCRIPTS Research Cluster of Excellence to efficiently catch up with recent developments in data science topics and tools.

In the Spring 2020 semester, I served as lead Teaching Assistant, developing course materials and assisting in the instruction of three sessions:

- [A gentle introduction to base `R` and RStudio](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-r-intro)
- [Modern data management with R](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-datamanagement)
- [Data Visualization with `ggplot2`](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/ds-workshop-dataviz)
