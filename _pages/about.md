About Me
------

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/birt/bgts/index.html) and the [Hertie School Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security). I am interested in using a variety of statistical and methodological tools to study the links between state repression of protests and online activism in authoritarian spheres of influence.

In addition to my doctoral studies, I also work as a Research Associate at the [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab) and the [SCRIPTS Data and Methodology Center](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/research/data-and-methodology-center/index.html). In this role, I develop training materials, support the implementation of data science workshops, and consult on statistical computing for graduate students and researchers. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new ways to wrangle and visualize data for communicating insights to a broader audience.

I graduated from Tulane University with a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies in 2016, after which I worked as an education consultant in Beijing, Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Sabah, Malaysia, and assistant to a regional director at Open Society Foundations in New York.
