About Me
------

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/birt/bgts/index.html) and the [Hertie School Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security). Broadly speaking, my research interests comprise of the politics and measurement of repression, political violence, and social media use. For my dissertation research, I am interested in using a variety of statistical and methodological tools to investigate how ICTs (in particular, social media) factor into regime strategies for engaging in repression against civilians.

In addition to my doctoral studies, I also work as a Research Associate at the [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab) and the [SCRIPTS Data and Methodology Center](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/research/data-and-methodology-center/index.html). In this role, I develop training materials, support the implementation of data science workshops, and consult on statistical computing for graduate students and researchers.
